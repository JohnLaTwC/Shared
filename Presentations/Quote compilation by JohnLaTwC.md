Your phone’s battery % tells you how productive you’ve been. (e.g. a low battery means you were distracted and on your phone a lot)

Assume positive intent — requires the same energy as negative.

Burned Toast.

Every single person you know is carrying something you know nothing about. You have no idea.

Two people in the same situation: one reaches new heights, the other is crushed by it. It’s the story we tell ourselves; it’s the meaning we assign.

One of the most meaningful aspects of life is not serving ourselves but serving others.

A person’s name is the sweetest sound in every [friend?].

You can pay a lot of people to have work done. You can’t pay someone to explain your problem. — Martin via NASA

“I’ve never found in my life that you could convince someone to work who doesn’t want to work hard to work hard.”

If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be.

Your number’s in the book.

Writing = thinking. Writing is a form of thought; it’s difficult for me to believe that real thought is possible w/o writing.

Don’t burst the thought bubble.

“Our ignorance of history causes us to slander our own times.” — Gustave Flaubert

Actually, it was pretty bad in the past. Don’t forget that.

“Of all the paths in life, make sure a few of them are dirt.”

“Building a tool with understanding combines power with purpose.”

“The proper use of a tool because it combines the externalization of knowledge (the tool) with the internalization of knowledge (skill).”

“I’ve tried nothing and I’m all out of ideas.” — The Simpsons

Kinship will withstand the rock.

A reverence for what cannot be controlled

Distrust of easy answers

Life’s truths emerge only through careful attention to the small, the local, the real

Quote then trail into silence, letting meaning take root

The world doesn’t yell its secrets. It murmurs them. You have to be quiet enough to hear

“Why sharpened pencils? Black ink is too arrogant. Pencils forgive”

Learn to communicate like your career depends on it. It’s the one skill that remains valuable regardless of the industry or job you pursue

Building a network / residual is the audience

“A real artist delights in roughness for what he can do to it”

I think over again my small adventures, my fears, these small ones that seemed so big. For all the vital things I had to get and reach. And yet there is only one great thing, the only thing: to live to see the great day that dawns and the light that fills the world. (Old Inuit song)

Your life is a reflection of what you’re giving your attention to

If you discover you have made a mistake, fix the mistake, then say what you’ve done. Fast. – Brad Smith

Creativity does not involve creating out of the void, but out of chaos

The doers are the real thinkers – Steve Jobs

“We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered” -- Rich Sutton

“Abusers can tell when someone is not defended and protected” -- Dr. Gabor Maté

Trauma is not what happens to you. It’s what happens inside you when it happens to you – Gabor Maté

Your problem is not the problem. Your addiction was your attempt to solve a problem. So don’t ask why the addiction. Ask why the pain – Gabor Maté

Fight: change the rules: I’ll tell you what I got wrong and you get it right and the other does the same

Amateurs resist their calling, professionals commit (show up no matter how they feel)

Resistance is the enemy

Identity shift is essential

Rituals and discipline replace addiction and escape

The professional lives by the soul’s code

The professional takes action consistently, regardless of mood or external reward, and treats their craft with seriousness

There is only one way and that is your way; there is only one salvation and that is your salvation. Why are you looking around for help? Do you believe that help will come from the outside? What is to come is created in you and from you. Hence look into yourself. Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and tempt you

You must fulfill the way that is in you – Carl Jung

Happiness comes from solving problems. Happiness is therefore a form of action; it’s an activity

People don’t experience your love. They experience how you show up

With our minds we create the world – Buddha

The mind with which you perceive the world, that’s the world you live in

Sam Harris on meditation:

> focus on breath to help you see how often thoughts invade and distract you. They possess you and carry you away

> It’s about paying attention to your experience

> You just start talking to yourself and forget about breathing

> Hopelessly carried away by it… like a light dream

> Dreaming has no reality test that starts by “hey, how did I get here? I was just in bed”

> You’re just helplessly thinking. You believe you’re the thinker. It produces all your goals, intentions, and actions

> Virtually all of your psychological suffering is a matter of being lost in thought

> “Pain and suffering are not the same thing”

> A flow of mentation that produces everything you do—your goals, actions, and intentions. It colors your experience every moment. Sounds, sensations, and thoughts can join them as just objects of consciousness

> You’re helplessly thinking all your life, every moment, so incessantly that you don’t even notice it. It’s like white noise

> You feel identified by your thoughts; you feel that you are the thinker. It’s completely structured by this flow of mentation

> Thoughts bubble up constantly, completely possessing you, coloring your experience every moment (happy, sad, angry), affecting your goals, actions, and intentions

> Identity is not intrinsic. It is a structure of consciousness. You are constantly carried off by the next thought—be it a task, the memory of some criticism, a feeling of anxiety over something, the feeling of the breeze

“I’m in the pain place. I’m in the place I came to seek.” – Goggins

“Not wanting something is as good as having it”

At the evening of our lives we shall be judged on love – St. John of the Cross

Monastery = a school of charity

In Christianity, the basic experience or enlightenment is that we are loved by God

“The Christian is, I believe, one who sacrifices the half-truth for the sake of the whole truth, who abandons an incomplete and imperfect concept of life for a life that is integrated, unified, and structurally perfect. Yet this entrance into such a life is not the end of the journey, but only the beginning. A long journey must follow: an anguished and sometimes perilous exploration. Of all Christians the monk is, or at least should be, the most professional of such explorers. His journey takes him through deserts and paradises for which no maps exist. He lives in strange areas of solitude, of emptiness, of joy, of perplexity and admiration”

“It is the peculiar office of the monk in the modern world to keep alive the contemplative experience and keep the way open for modern technological man to recover the integrity of his own inner depths.” – Thomas Merton / Brother Patrick Hart, Abbey of Gethsemani

Every day stand guard at the door of your mind – Jim Rohn

“How come you’re up so early?” Answer: if you were headed where I’m headed you’d be up early too, or if you were going to meet who I’m going to meet you’d be up early too

You can have more than you got because you can become more than you are

You aren’t the thinker of your thoughts, you are their witness

On thinking about thinking: first thought is a ripple, second thought is a ripple reacting to the first. You are not a ripple. You are the water

Concentration is a narrowing of entropy. Attention is selection or amplification or a spotlight

It’s not the people, it’s the decisions.

Your choices, your actions. That’s what makes you who you are.

Buddhist Monk: if you’re carrying a cup of coffee and someone bumps into you why did you spill the coffee? It wasn’t because someone bumped you. It was because you were carrying coffee. (If you had been carrying water you’d have spilled water. If you’d have been carrying love, compassion, grace.)

Don’t quit today—that’s emotion. Quit tomorrow. If you can keep quitting tomorrow you can do anything.

“To go in the dark with a light is to know the light. To know the dark, go dark. Go without sight, and find that the dark too blooms and sings, and is traveled by dark feet and dark wings.” -- Wendell Berry

“I lack the peace of simple things. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water.” -- Wendell Berry

There is a day when the road neither comes nor goes, and the way isn’t a way but a place.

“Rejoice for the thorns have roses.”

“Paper has more patience than people.”

“Relationships aren’t tough. They are only tough when one person’s working on it. Two people can move a couch.” – Chris Rock

While orbiting the moon, the astronauts felt no wind, no atmosphere, no natural oxygen. When Lovell finally splashed down in the Pacific and opened the hatch, he said the rush of fresh moist air produced a lasting epiphany: “Earth,” he said, “is paradise.”

Ask what you are afraid of? Then ask why? Then why again until you know what you’re afraid of.

Our understanding of the world is strongly influenced by the language we speak. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (1956).

“Don’t bring me good news because I can’t act on it. Bring me bad news because I can act on it.”  --igor

Write down the good things with how I felt about it.

True and contradictory at the same time: “You are what you think.” “You aren’t your thoughts, you’re their witness.”

Oh, she says, well, you’re not a poor man. You know, why don’t you go online and buy 100 envelopes and put them in the closet? And so I pretended not to hear her and went out to get an envelope because I’m going to have a hell of a good time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And I see some great looking babies. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And I’ll ask a woman what kind of dog that is…we’re dancing animals. You know, we love to move around.

Anger is the part of you that loves you the most. It’s the part that shows up when you’re being mistreated, ignored, or disrespected.

From a comedian (you only have 2 things to worry about): “You’re either healthy or sick. If you’re healthy, you’re ok. If you’re sick you only have two things to worry about. Is it going to get better or is it going to get worse? If better, you’re ok. If worse, you only have two things to worry about. Are you going to live or die? If live, you’re ok. If die, you only have two things to worry about. Going to heaven or hell? If heaven, you’re ok…”

On disagreeing politely: “Seems like you have a reason for saying that. I’ve got different data.”

When a tree falls everyone hears the sound, but when a tree grows no one hears it.

The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people.

Life disguised as growth as failure.

A compliment: “Thank you for being you.”

He who opens a school door, closes a prison.

Education without moral grounding creates not saints, but more sophisticated sinners.

You’re 5 minutes away from feeling better. 5 minutes of exercise—your energy shifts. 5 minutes of writing—your mind clears. 5 minutes of deep breathing—your body resets.

I do the very best I know how—the very best I can, and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against me won’t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.

Relationships with influencers and reporters don’t keep negative stories from happening, they give us a chance to engage and make our case.

Love keeps no records of wrongs.

"Yes, but Icarus also flew."
